# Info

This project is a fork from https://github.com/aerokube/images.
In the current project the buiding of the yandex-browser image has beenchanged so that the image is built with the [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) instead of [YandexDriver](https://github.com/yandex/YandexDriver).

# Example:

```sh
./images yandex \
-b 22.11.0.2484-1 \
-d 106.0.5249.61 \
-t my/yandex-browser:22.11.0.2484-1
```
